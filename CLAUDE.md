## 💡 Core Concepts

### Thinking Mode vs Writing Mode

This vault is designed for AI-assisted **thinking**, not just AI-assisted **writing**.

**Thinking Mode (Research & Exploration):**
- Claude asks questions to understand your goals
- Searches existing notes for relevant content
- Helps make connections between ideas
- Maintains a log of insights and progress

**Writing Mode (Content Creation):**
- Generates drafts based on your research
- Helps structure and edit content
- Creates final deliverables

**Usage Recommendations:**
1. **Start in Thinking Mode** - Resist the urge to generate content immediately
2. **Explore thoroughly** - Ask questions, search existing notes, build connections
3. **Confirm direction** - Once goals and approach are clear, switch to Writing Mode
4. **Save everything** - Chat logs, fragments, partial thoughts all have value

**Example Prompts:**
```
I'm starting a new project about [topic].
I'm in thinking mode, not writing mode.
Please search my vault for any relevant existing notes,
then help me explore this topic by asking questions.
```

### The PARA Method Explained

**Projects** - Have a deadline and specific outcome
- **Definition:** Time-bound efforts with clear goals
- **Examples:** "Q1 2025 Job Search Strategy", "ESP32 Autodiary Tool", "Novel Chapter 1"
- **Location:** `01_Projects/`
- **Characteristics:** Clear start and end dates, measurable outcomes
- **Lifecycle:** Initiation → Research → Development → Review → Completion → Archive

**Areas** - Ongoing without an end date
- **Definition:** Ongoing responsibilities requiring continuous attention
- **Examples:** "Health", "Finances", "Career Development", "Professional Network"
- **Location:** `02_Areas/`
- **Characteristics:** Define your roles and commitments, need regular maintenance
- **Maintenance:** Weekly scans, monthly reviews, quarterly deep dives

**Resources** - Topics of ongoing interest
- **Definition:** Reference materials and evergreen notes knowledge base
- **Examples:** "AI Product Management", "Hardware Design Patterns", "Writing Techniques"
- **Location:** `03_Resources/`
- **Characteristics:** Organized by topic not source, evergreen not ephemeral
- **Principles:** One concept per note, self-contained understanding, heavily linked

**Archive** - Inactive items
- **Definition:** Completed or inactive projects preserved for future reference
- **Examples:** Completed projects with summaries, abandoned ideas
- **Location:** `04_Archive/`
- **Characteristics:** Preserves institutional memory, past informs future

**Decision Criteria:**
```
Has deadline and specific outcome?  → Project (01_Projects)
Ongoing without end date?           → Area (02_Areas)
Reference material or knowledge?    → Resource (03_Resources)
Completed or inactive?              → Archive (04_Archive)
Quick capture, unorganized?         → Inbox (00_Inbox)
```

**Project vs Area Comparison:**
| Area (Ongoing) | Project (Time-bound) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "Health" | "Lose 10 pounds by June" |
| "Finances" | "Create 2025 budget" |
| "Writing" | "Finish blog post series" |
| "Learning" | "Complete Python course" |
| "Job Search" | "Land AI PM position" |

## 📁 Your Custom PARA Structure

### 00_Inbox - Quick Capture Zone

Temporary holding area for new ideas and unprocessed information.

**Purpose:**
- Daily notes and journaling
- Web clippings and interesting finds
- Meeting notes before processing
- Random thoughts and ideas

**Weekly Processing Workflow:**
1. Capture first, organize later - Don't slow down to categorize
2. Use daily notes - One note per day for stream of consciousness
3. Dump links and quotes - Save now, process later
4. Don't let it pile up - Process weekly

**Processing Principles:**
- Project-related notes → `01_Projects/`
- Ongoing topics → `02_Areas/`
- Reference material → `03_Resources/`
- Completed items → `04_Archive/`
- No longer relevant → Delete

**File Naming Suggestions:**
- Daily notes: `2025-12-30.md`
- Quick captures: `2025-12-30 - Meeting with Team.md`
- Web clips: `2025-12-30 - Article Title - Source.md`
- Ideas: `Idea - Brief Description.md`

### 04_Archive - Archive Storage

Stores completed or inactive content.

**What Goes Here:**
- Completed projects with their final deliverables
- Cancelled projects with lessons learned
- Projects inactive for 30+ days
- Areas no longer relevant
- Processed Inbox items

**Archival Process:**

1. **Before Archiving Projects:**
   - Create completion summary
   - Extract reusable insights to Resources
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update any related Areas
   - Move entire folder with structure intact

2. **Completion Summary Template:**
   ```markdown
   # Project: [Name] - Completion Summary

   **Duration:** Start - End
   **Status:** Completed/Cancelled/Suspended

   ## Objectives
   - Original goal 1 ✓
   - Original goal 2 ✓
   - Original goal 3 ✗

   ## Key Outcomes
   - What was delivered
   - What impact it had

   ## Lessons Learned
   - What worked well
   - What didn't work
   - What to do differently

   ## Reusable Assets
   - Templates: [[link]]
   - Processes: [[link]]
   - Insights: [[link]]
   ```

**Archive Philosophy:**
- Not a graveyard - Archives preserve institutional memory
- Not a dumping ground - Archive thoughtfully, maintain organization
- Old projects inform new ones
- Ideas can be resurrected

### 05_Attachments - Attachment Storage

Centralized storage for images, PDFs, and other non-text files.

**Organization Structure:**
```
05_Attachments/
├── Organized/          # Processed files with good names
│   ├── Images/
│   ├── PDFs/
│   └── Data/
├── IMG_*.png          # Unprocessed phone images
├── Screenshot*.png    # Unprocessed screenshots
└── *.pdf             # Various PDFs
```

**Naming Conventions:**
- **Before processing:** `IMG_1234.png`, `Screenshot 2025-12-30.png`
- **After processing:** `2025-12-30_ESP32_Circuit_Diagram.png`, `API_Documentation_v2.pdf`

**Best Practices:**
- Process weekly - Don't let files pile up

### Gemini Vision (MCP Configured)

Google Gemini Vision is configured via MCP server, enabling Claude Code to directly process images and documents without manual API setup.

**Features:**
- **Direct image analysis:** Claude sees the actual image, not your description
- **PDF text extraction:** Full document text without copy-pasting
- **Bulk processing:** Analyze multiple screenshots or documents at once
- **Smart organization:** Auto-generate filenames based on image content
- **Comparison tasks:** Compare before/after screenshots, designs, etc.

**Why this matters:** Instead of describing "a screenshot showing an error message", Claude Code directly sees and reads the error. Perfect for debugging UI issues, analyzing charts, or processing scanned documents.

**Usage:**
```
Analyze this image: 05_Attachments/circuit-diagram.png
What components are shown?
```

See `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for MCP server configuration details

### Obsidian Vault Management (MCP Configured)

Obsidian MCP server is configured, enabling direct vault operations, advanced search, and link management without manual file operations.

**Features:**

**1. Note Operations**
- **Create notes** - Generate new notes with frontmatter and content
- **Read notes** - Access note content and metadata
- **Update notes** - Modify existing notes (replace or append)
- **Delete notes** - Remove notes safely

**2. Search & Query**
- **Content search** - Find notes by text, tags, or properties
- **Date-based search** - Filter by creation or modification date
- **Property search** - Query by frontmatter metadata
- **List all notes** - Get vault inventory

**3. Tag Management**
- **Add tags** - Tag notes for organization
- **Update tags** - Modify tag lists (merge or replace)
- **Remove tags** - Clean up tags
- **List all tags** - See tag taxonomy

**4. Link Management**
- **Backlinks** - Find notes linking to current note
- **Outgoing links** - See what current note references
- **Broken links** - Identify and fix dead links
- **Orphaned notes** - Find notes with no connections

**Why this matters:** Automate vault maintenance, ensure PARA structure compliance, batch process notes, and maintain knowledge graph health - all programmatically through Claude Code.

**Usage Examples:**
```
Search all notes tagged with #job-search and list them by date

Find all notes in 01_Projects that haven't been updated in 30 days

Create a new daily note in 00_Inbox with today's date

Find all broken links in the vault and suggest fixes
```

See `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for MCP server configuration details

---

### Chromium Browser Automation (MCP Configured)

Chromium browser automation is configured via MCP server, enabling automated web scraping, page interaction, and content extraction directly in Claude Code.

**Features:**
- **Full page capture:** Navigate, screenshot, and extract content from live web pages
- **Interactive automation:** Click, fill forms, navigate through multi-page flows
- **JavaScript execution:** Run custom scripts in the browser context
- **Content extraction:** Get clean text or full HTML from any page
- **Visual verification:** Take screenshots at any point in automation
- **Network monitoring:** Inspect network requests and console logs

**Why this matters:** Automate repetitive web tasks, extract dynamic content that requires JavaScript, debug web applications, and scrape content from complex sites - all without leaving Claude Code.

**Usage Examples:**
```
Navigate to https://example.com and extract the main article text

Take a screenshot of the page and analyze the layout

Click the "Load More" button and extract all product listings
```

**Fallback Option:**
If browser automation is unavailable or fails, Firecrawl MCP can be used as a simpler alternative for basic web scraping (requires API key configuration).

See `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for MCP server configuration details

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Claude Code Can't Find My Notes

**Symptom:** Claude says it can't find a note or file

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you're running Claude Code from the vault root directory
- Check file permissions: `ls -la [file path]`
- Verify markdown files have `.md` extension
- Check filename spelling and case

### Git Conflicts

**Symptom:** Conflicts when pulling or pushing

**Solutions:**
- Always `git pull` before starting work
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Use branches for experimental changes
- When conflicts occur:
  ```bash
  git status  # See conflicted files
  # Manually edit conflicted files
  git add .
  git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
  ```

### Attachments Management Issues

**Symptom:** Attachment files are messy, can't find files

**Solutions:**
- Run `pnpm attachments:create-organized` to set up folders
- Use `pnpm attachments:orphans` to find orphaned files
- Keep attachments under 10MB for Git
- Use Git LFS for large files or external storage
- Regular cleanup: `pnpm attachments:sizes` to find large files

### Gemini Vision Not Working

**Symptom:** Image analysis commands fail or no response

**Solutions:**
- Check environment variable: `echo $GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Verify API key validity (login to Google AI Studio)
- See `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for full configuration
- Restart Claude Code session
- Check API quota: visit Google AI Studio dashboard

### Obsidian MCP Issues

**Symptom:** Can't read/write notes, search fails, or operations timeout

**Solutions:**
- Verify MCP server is running and connected to vault
- Check vault path is correct in MCP configuration
- Ensure note paths use forward slashes (`/`) not backslashes
- For search failures, simplify query - try basic text search first
- If notes aren't found, verify file has `.md` extension
- For permission errors, check file/folder permissions: `ls -la`

**Common Issues:**
- **"Note not found"**: Check exact path and spelling, include `.md`
- **"Invalid path"**: Paths are relative to vault root, no leading `/`
- **Search returns nothing**: Check tag format (`#tag` vs `tag`)
- **Links broken**: Verify wiki-link format `[[note-name]]` not `@note-name`

### Chromium Browser Automation Issues

**Symptom:** Navigation or content extraction fails

**Solutions:**
- Verify MCP server is running: Check Claude Code MCP status
- Some websites may block automation - try different sites to test
- Check if JavaScript is required - Chromium handles this automatically
- For complex sites, break down navigation into smaller steps
- Use screenshots to debug - verify what the browser sees
- Check console errors with network monitoring tools

**Fallback:** If browser automation fails consistently, Firecrawl MCP can be used as a simpler alternative (requires API key configuration)

### Performance Issues

**Symptom:** Vault is slow to respond, search is slow

**Solutions:**
- Check vault size: `pnpm vault:stats`
- Clean up large attachments: `pnpm attachments:sizes`
- Archive old projects to `04_Archive/`
- Delete unnecessary files
- Consider splitting into multiple vaults (work/personal)

### Can't Find a Feature

**Symptom:** Remember there's a command but can't find it

**Solutions:**
- Check this file for complete command list
- Look in `.claude/commands/` directory
- Check `package.json` scripts section
- Check README.md in each folder
- Use `/help` in Claude Code for assistance
